        <p>Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) developed by Microsoft to develop GUI(Graphical User Interface), console, Web applications, web apps, mobile apps, cloud, and web services, etc. With the help of this IDE, you can create managed code as well as native code.
            <h3>How to set Visual Studio ?</h3>
            <h5>Getting Started with Visual Studio</h5>

First, you have to download and install the Visual Studio. For that, you can refer to Downloading and Installing Visual Studio. Don’t forget to select the .NET core workload during the installation of. If you forget then you have to modify the installation.
You can see a number of tool windows when you will open the Visual Studio and start writing your first program as follows:
<h5>
1 Code Editor: Where the user will write code.
2 Output Window: Here the Visual Studio shows the outputs, compiler warnings, error messages and debugging information.
3 Solution Explorer: It shows the files on which the user is currently working.
4 Properties: It will give additional information and context about the selected parts of the current project.
</h5>
A user can also add windows as per requirement by choosing them from View menu. In Visual Studio the tool windows are customizable as a user can add more windows, remove the existing open one or can move windows around to best suit.
Various Menus in Visual Studio: A user can find a lot of menus on the top screen of Visual Studio.

1 Create, Open and save projects commands are contained by File menu.
2 Searching, Modifying, Refactoring code commands are contained by the Edit menu.
3 View Menu is used to open the additional tool windows in Visual Studio.
4 Project menu is used to add some files and dependencies in the project.
5 To change the settings, add functionality to Visual Studio via extensions, and access various Visual Studio tools can be used by using Tools menu.
The menu is known as the toolbar which provide the quick access to the most frequently used commands. You can add and remove the commands by going to View → Customize

        <h2>Consoles</h2>
        <p>A console traditionally refers to a computer terminal where a user may input commands and view output such as the results of inputted commands or status messages from the computer. The console is often connected to a remote computer or computer system that is controlled from the console.
        <h3>Why is it used ?</h3>
        A console application is primarily designed for the following reasons: To provide a simple user interface for applications requiring little or no user interaction, such as samples for learning C# language features and command-line utility programs.
        <h2> How to Open console and Print something on it</h2>
        You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.

        <script>console.log("My first console project");
            var first_name="Ranbir";
            var last_name="Kapoor";
            var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);
            var square_root=Math.sqrt(9);
            console.log(square_root);
            var maxi_number=Math.max(2,8);
            console.log (maxi_number);
            var mini_number=Math.min(2,8);
            console.log (mini_number);
            var power_eg_1=Math.pow(4,2);
            console.log (power_eg_1);
